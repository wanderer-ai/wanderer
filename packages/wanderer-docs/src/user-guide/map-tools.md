# ðŸ”¨ Map tools
The whole conversation builder is optimized to edit and view the chat flow graph. Imagine the graph like some kind of a mind map. The map tools will appear on the top left corner of the map if some nodes are selected. These tools will provide functions like edit, remove or connecting nodes and edges.

## Map navigation
* Zoom and pan: Use you mousewheel to zoom in and out of your graph. Grap the flow at some white area and use the mouse to pan the map.
* Drag and drop vertices: You can move selected vertices around by grabbing them with the mouse. Note: The origin node cannot be moved.
* Select vertices and edges: Click an a vertex or an edge to select them. You can also hold down the ctrl or shift key and use the left mouse button to select multiple edges and vertices.

## Delete vertices and edges
Select one or more vertices or edges and click the trash symbol inside the toolbar.
Note: You can temporary disable vertices or large structures inside your graph by just deleting the connecting endge.

## Connect vertices together.
You can connect two vertices together by selecting them one after another. The order in which the vertices are selected will determine the direction of the new edge. After you have selected two vertices the connect symbol will show up in the toolbar. Note: You can only connect comatible vertices together.

## Edit vertices and edges
Double click on vertices or edges will open the data editor. There you can specify the attributes of each vertex and edge. You can also select a vertice or an edge and use the edit tool from the toolbar.

## Circular context menu
Hover over a vertex and hold down the right mouse button to open the context menu. This menu offers you a quick way to create and connect new vertices to the one you have hovered.
