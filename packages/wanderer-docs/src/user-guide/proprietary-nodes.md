# Proprietary nodes
You may have noticed that some nodes have a small crown. These are proprietary nodes. You can use these nodes in your flows at any time. Please remember that you need a professional license if you want to operate your chatbot on your own domain or in your own app with such nodes in use. With the Wanderer.ai domain, you can use these nodes at any time for free.

Please refer to the license agreement for more details: [https://wanderer.ai/license/](https://wanderer.ai/license/)
