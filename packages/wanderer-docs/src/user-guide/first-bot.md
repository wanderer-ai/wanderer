# ðŸ¤– Build your first bot
Here's how to build your first simple bot.

## Quick start
Open the builder and select "New Project" to create a new flow.
The large yellow origin node of the flow has already been created. This is the starting point of your new flow. Double-click the new flow to edit it.
Give your flow a meaningful name. For example `My first flow`. Then close the editing window.

To insert your first message, hold down the right mouse button over the origin node and select "leads to message" from the circle menu.
The message appears immediately on the map. It also appears in the chat window. Click on the chat icon in the lower right to open it.
Then double-click the message to edit it. Enter a welcome text. For example, `Nice to see you here!`.
If you want, you can create a second message. To do this, hold down the right mouse button over the last message you created to insert another message.

## Add your first question
Just as you can add new message nodes, you can easily create many other nodes as well. For example, insert a question that is connected to the last message node.
Then edit the new node and enter a meaningful question. For example, `How are you today?`.
In order for the question to appear in the chat, it still needs answer options.

Hold the right mouse button over the question and select "is answerable by suggestion".
Then edit the answer and give it a text. For example `I am fine`.
Then, based on the question, create a second answer option and give it a text. For example. `I feel bad`.
The question with both answer options should now appear in the chat.
