# Toolbar
On the top right corner of the screen you will notice the toolbar. This is the place from where you can start or restore projects and where you can download your current work.

## Start a tutorial
From the project dialog you can start a tutorial bot to learn the basics of the builder.

## Create a new project
Let's get started by creating a new project. Just click on the disk icon and select "New rroject".

## Download a project
Save your project by clicking on the file symbol inside the toolbar. Then, inside the dialog, click on "Download Project".
You will be asked where you want to store the file. Store the file wherever you want.
Important note: Wanderer.ai will not store any files for you! So it's a good idea to download your current work before you close the browser.

## Restore a project from a local file
Click on the disk icon and select "Restore from file" from the project dialog. A file browser will appear. Just navigate to a folder containing your Wanderer.ai .json files and select it.

## Restore a project from URL
You can also restore a file from a URL. Just copy the full URL to the dialog and click on "Restore from URL".

## Switch languages for your project
Your chat project can hold several translations for all nodes in the flow. You can view and edit those languages by switching the current language inside the language manager.
Click on the flags icon inside the toolbar to open the language manager. There you can choose the current language for the conversation builder.
Inside the language manager you can also add new languages to your project or you can remove existing languages.
You can also switch the language instantly inside of edit dialogs. This prvides a very fast way of comparing and checking several translations.
